                    MOSAIC (<b>M</b>eta-<b>O</b>rganization of <b>S</b>timuli <b>A</b>nd <b>I</b>maging data <b>C</b>ollections) is a procedure to 
                    aggregate individual fMRI datasets to achieve scale in terms of number of subjects, number of stimuli, diversity of stimuli, and amount of brain data. 
                    The procedure has two main components to (1) register and preprocess fMRI data using a shared pipeline and (2) resolve stimuli test/train set conflicts.

                    Why is MOSAIC useful?

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The MOSAIC framework increases the number of subjects, stimuli, and amount of brain data to achieve scale and diversity impossible with just a single research group.
                    MOSAIC allows stringent tests of generalizability across held-out datasets and subjects and can support data-hungry analysis techniques, such as training brain-optimized
                    models. It also provides the necessary scaffolding for methodological advancements, such as inter-subject and inter-dataset functional alignment or optimizing preprocessing pipelines.

                    How did you select the datasets incorporated into this initial release of MOSAIC?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    We scoped dataset selection to fMRI, vision, event-related experimental design, large scale (in terms of number of subjects, stimuli, or repetitions), and publicly available in BIDS format.
                    Therefore, long-form movie, audio-visual, and M/EEG datasets, and small-scale datasets are some examples of what were excluded for this initial release. However, researchers are more than
                    welcome to add datasets for another version of MOSAIC!

                <div class="faq-question">
                    Can I add more datasets to MOSAIC?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! Researchers can add other datasets post-hoc. In this way the MOSAIC dataset
                    can flexibly incorporate the latest dataset and evolve alongside advances in experimental design and methodology.
                    Any additions will be community-driven, meaning there will be no "official" additions to MOSAIC. If you edit this initial
                    release of MOSAIC, be sure to clearly document the changes and release the relevant code/data.

                    Do you have any insights for training a brain-optimized network?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Training brain-optimized networks is still relatively new, and cross-subject, cross-dataset, and the amount of noise in fMRI data 
                    can make training tricky. Informally, we have found:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Predicting trial-averaged fMRI responses works much better than single-trial responses. Single-trial responses have more
                            noise and selecting a random single-trial as a target can make it extremely difficult for the model to learn.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MSE loss alone can lead to the model optimizing for a handful of vertices. The train/val loss curve may seem healthy, but other 
                            metrics, such as voxelwise encoding, may be poor. Adding a smoothness term (e.g., enforcing neighboring vertices to be similar values)
                            helps address this issue.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Subject-specific batches can be important if your loss function uses batch-wise reliability metrics.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Are there any licensing restrictions when using this dataset?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes. We expect every user to abide by each individual dataset's own licensing and terms of use. Unfortunately, licensing can 
                    get a bit complicated. The fMRI data itself usually comes with far fewer restrictions than the associated stimuli, so do your
                    diligence when using the data and preparing a manuscript.
